# vivintpy

## Overview

**vivintpy** is an unofficial, reverse-engineered Python client for the Vivint Smart Home API. It enables programmatic access to Vivint security systems, devices, and real-time events, and is suitable for automation, research, and integration with platforms like Home Assistant.

- **Async-first**: Modern asyncio-based design for efficient I/O.
- **Device support**: Alarm panels, cameras, locks, garage doors, switches, thermostats, and sensors.
- **Real-time**: PubNub event subscription for instant device updates.
- **Extensible**: Typed device classes, event emitter pattern, and modular architecture.

## Architecture

```
Account (high-level API)
  ‚îî‚îÄ VivintSkyApi (HTTP/gRPC, Auth, MFA)
      ‚îî‚îÄ System(s) ‚Üí AlarmPanel(s) ‚Üí Device(s)
          ‚îî‚îÄ PubNub Listener (real-time events)
```

- `account.py`: User/session management, system/device discovery, PubNub connection.
- `api.py`: Handles authentication, REST/gRPC calls, token refresh, error handling.
- `devices/`: Device type wrappers (Camera, Lock, Switch, etc.)
- `pubnub.py`: Real-time event subscription and dispatch.

See `demo.py` for a working example.
