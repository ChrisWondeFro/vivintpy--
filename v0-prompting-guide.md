Prompting Guide for v0 (by Vercel)‚Äîmerged with best practices from the v0 Crash Course‚Äîto help generate polished, production-ready UI and app prototypes.

‚∏ª

1. üéØ Start with a Specific & Structured Prompt
	‚Ä¢	Define purpose clearly (platform, target users, core flows).
	‚Ä¢	Provide a brief PRD: outline product overview, user flows, key pages/components (use bullet lists or numbered sections)  Ôøº Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally, refine your prompt using ChatGPT or Claude to ensure structure and clarity  Ôøº.

‚∏ª

2. Iterative Refinement & Component-Level Control
	‚Ä¢	Use v0‚Äôs select mode to target and tweak individual components: resize, restyle, update behaviors .
	‚Ä¢	Break prompts into sections: request UI in logical chunks (e.g., navigation bar, input forms, result cards) for controlled buildout  Ôøº.

‚∏ª

3. Include References & Context
	‚Ä¢	Provide URL or image snapshots of existing designs for inspiration or replication.
	‚Ä¢	v0 will attempt to mirror layouts using Tailwind + shadcn/ui  Ôøº Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Include Figma links or frames, ideally structured into discrete components, to guide accuracy .

‚∏ª

4. Pull from Component Libraries
	‚Ä¢	Ask for specific components (e.g., shadcn/ui Button, Modal). Use v0‚Äôs ‚ÄúOpen in v0‚Äù directly from library repos to import and customize  Ôøº.

‚∏ª

5. Enforce Tech Stack & Architecture Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Clearly state: ‚ÄúUse React + Next.js App Router, fetch from /api/..., integrate with Firebase/Supabase‚Äù to generate production-ready scaffolding .

‚∏ª

6. Style, Accessibility & Microcopy
	‚Ä¢	Specify typographic styles, colors, hover/focus states early.
	‚Ä¢	For tone: e.g., ‚Äúfriendly financial coach‚Äù voice‚Äîuse ChatGPT to rewrite microcopy before feeding it into v0  Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Include aria labels and a11y best practices in prompts .

‚∏ª

7. Embed Data & Integrations
	‚Ä¢	Instruct v0 to scaffold API calls or fetch logic from endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	Ask it to map components over data arrays and handle dynamic formatting and error states .

‚∏ª

8. Leverage Versioning & Collaboration
	‚Ä¢	Use v0‚Äôs version control to track iterations and rollback as needed .
	‚Ä¢	Use fork to branch off others‚Äô shared templates while preserving your own baseline .

‚∏ª

9. Share & Deploy with Ease
	‚Ä¢	Use built-in Share to share interactive preview and chat context.
	‚Ä¢	Hit Deploy to publish on Vercel with CLI or dashboard scaffolding  Ôøº.

‚∏ª

10. Maximizing Overall Workflow Efficiency
	‚Ä¢	Start high-level, then drill down: generate page ‚Üí revise components ‚Üí refine style & copy ‚Üí add data & deploy .
	‚Ä¢	Use external tools (ChatGPT PRD writer, Figma kits) for polished input.
	‚Ä¢	One UI piece per prompt, review, then build next‚Äîavoid ‚Äúmonolithic‚Äù prompts  Ôøº.

‚úÖ Sample Starter Prompt

Build a responsive pricing page for a SaaS dashboard using React + Next.js App Router.
- Platform: Desktop + mobile web
- Target users: Small business owners
- Layout:
  1. Header with logo + nav
  2. Pricing toggle (monthly/yearly)
  3. Three plan cards: Basic, Pro, Enterprise
     - Features list, CTA
- Styling: brand colors (#00A8E8 primary, #F5A623 accent), Tailwind CSS
- Accessibility: aria-labels, focus outlines
- Fetch plan info from /api/plans (JSON)
- Use shadcn/ui components & Heroicons
Once generated, select the plan cards and update hover states and aria labels.
